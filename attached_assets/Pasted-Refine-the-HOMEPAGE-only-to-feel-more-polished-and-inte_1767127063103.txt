Refine the HOMEPAGE only to feel more polished and intentional by reducing the “stacked rectangles” look.

Do not rewrite copy, do not change global typography/fonts, and do not redesign the overall layout (nav, hero, section structure). Keep the style clean, professional, and restrained—this should feel like an institutional/serious project, not a template or a playful landing page.

PRIMARY GOAL
Create a more continuous, cohesive visual flow between sections using:
1) shared visual fields (“chapters”) where multiple sections sit on a continuous background treatment
2) subtle soft-edge fades/gradients at a small number of transitions
3) ONE (1) organic/curved transition moment used intentionally (not repeated)

KEY CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT apply curved/wavy transitions to every section.
- Use at most ONE organic curve/wave across the entire homepage (one hero-to-content transition OR one mid-page pivot transition).
- Avoid busy patterns, repeated SVG dividers, or anything that looks decorative.
- Avoid adding box borders / card containers around every section.
- Keep changes reversible and mostly CSS + minimal markup changes.

WHAT TO IMPLEMENT

A) Shared visual fields (“chapters”)
- Group adjacent sections into 2–4 visual chapters by giving them a shared background treatment so they feel continuous.
- Example: a “Problem” chapter might include 1–2 sections on the same subtle background; a “Solution/Vision” chapter might be another; etc.
- The shared background should be very subtle (light tint, soft texture, or gentle gradient) and must remain consistent with existing site colors.
- Within a chapter, minimize visible separators—let spacing and hierarchy do the work.

B) Soft edge fades (subtle, limited)
- Add subtle top/bottom fades between major chapters so the transition feels smooth rather than abrupt.
- Keep fades extremely subtle (no obvious gradient bands).
- Use this only at 1–3 chapter boundaries max.

C) One organic moment (single use)
- Implement ONE organic/curved edge transition (SVG separator OR clip-path) at a single key boundary:
  - either between the hero and the first content chapter, OR
  - at a major mid-page pivot (e.g., “It doesn’t have to be this way”).
- The curve should be shallow and elegant (not wavy or playful).
- Make sure it never creates horizontal overflow and behaves well on mobile.

D) Maintain readability and hierarchy
- Preserve existing spacing and typography rhythm, but you may slightly refine vertical padding/margins for better flow.
- Ensure headings remain visually distinct and scanning is easy.
- Ensure nothing overlaps or crowds at breakpoints.

E) Responsive sanity checks
- No horizontal scrolling.
- Mobile should still feel clean and readable.
- The left/right alignment and section spacing should remain consistent.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement these homepage-only improvements.
- Briefly list what you changed (which sections are grouped into chapters, where fades were added, and where the single organic curve was placed).
- Keep the overall look subtle and professional—visually “more finished,” not “more decorated.”
