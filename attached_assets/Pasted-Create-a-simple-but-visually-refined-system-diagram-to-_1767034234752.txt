Create a simple but visually refined system diagram to illustrate Mosaic’s role in creating coherence across a decentralized social media ecosystem.

Visual reference: Use the attached hexagon image as a loose structural reference (a central hexagon with six surrounding hexagons), but feel free to interpret it creatively rather than copying it exactly.

Design guidance
	•	Seven hexagons total, arranged in a cohesive cluster
	•	One central hexagon labeled “Mosaic”
	•	Six surrounding hexagons representing key ecosystem domains
	•	Clean, modern, diagrammatic style (not illustrative or realistic)
	•	Gradients are allowed and encouraged if they remain subtle and tasteful
	•	Use the Mosaic color palette (blues, gold/yellow, burgundy, red) to create visual differentiation
	•	Soft depth, gentle gradients, or light shading are acceptable
	•	White or very light background preferred

Hexagon labels
	•	Center: Mosaic
	•	Surrounding hexagons:
	•	Governance
	•	Protocols
	•	Web Standards
	•	Performance
	•	Business Models
	•	Spaces (or Community Spaces, if that reads more clearly)

Conceptual intent
	•	Mosaic sits at the center as the connective architecture
	•	The surrounding domains remain independent but interoperable
	•	The diagram should communicate integration without centralization
	•	Avoid framing Mosaic as a platform or monolith

Accompanying copy (place near the diagram)

Headline:
What’s been missing is coherence.

Body copy:
Many of the core building blocks already exist—governance frameworks, open protocols, web standards, scalable infrastructure, sustainable business models, and independent social spaces.

Mosaic connects these elements into a unified, decentralized, and performant social media ecosystem—one capable of operating at scale and competing with Big Tech platforms without sacrificing human agency or the public good.

Implementation constraints
	•	Static site only (HTML + CSS)
	•	SVG, CSS shapes, or a combination are all acceptable
	•	No JavaScript frameworks required
	•	Focus on clarity and visual elegance over complexity

Implement this section and stop.
